Having some information about the question in the column names would be nice. Some columns have missing values that could be filled easily based on other columns. Columns with free-form entries will be hard to work with but still contain useful information. Luckily, all the questions that are required to submit the survey appear to have no missing values and many can be binned into categories. "

    "- How did cleaning the dataset improve its usability for machine learning?\n",
    "- What would happen if we trained a model on the messy dataset vs. the cleaned one?\n",

    "\n",
    "The biggest issues were dealing with free-form entries and trying to wittle down categories. All the different spellings people used for \"United States\" were annoying to deal with. Figuring out how to deal with all the extra categories and missing values in some columns simultaneously was challenging. For some columns like city and state, limiting to the most common categories and setting the rest to 'other' was the best option. For others like industry, I had to set a threshold for the number of samples in each category. Luckily, some options for inputs into the survey aligned with a good imputation value for missing values in other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary, the target variable was also tricky to clean. I had to decide what the model's purpose was and clean the data accordingly. Removing erroneous data and outliers was what I decided on to give the model the best chance of predicting accurately. I was able to clean the data to the point where it is usable in a model. I don't know how well it will perform, but I did my best to preserve as much information as I could while not injecting too much bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I did inject a lot of bias. I made a lot of assumptions along the way and I even had to curtail the scope of the model to only be for the US. There are probably a million and one ways that I could have done this better, but if this assignment showed me anything, it's that cleaning real-world data is hard. Especially if it is crowd-sourced data with free-form entries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning I performed, certainly improved the usability for machine learning. All the columns are now categorical or numerical (boolean being considered 0s and 1s) and once encoded, this data could be used to fit a model to predict the salary (plus additional compensation) of a person in the US being paid in USD. The error rate of the model is yet unknown and through testing, better cleaning processes could be developed, but I think I did a good job of cleaning the data to the best of my ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ML model likely couldn't have been trained on the messy data. It would have to be a pretty advanced model to parse any data from the mess that this data started as. The cleaning I did was necessary to get the data into a format that a model could be trained on. The model trained on the messy data would likely have a very high error rate and not be very useful if it could be trained at all. "
