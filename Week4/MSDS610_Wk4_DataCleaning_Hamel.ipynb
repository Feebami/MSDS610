Having some information about the question in the column names would be nice. Some columns have missing values that could be filled easily based on other columns. Columns with free-form entries will be hard to work with but still contain useful information. Luckily, all the questions that are required to submit the survey appear to have no missing values and many can be binned into categories. "
